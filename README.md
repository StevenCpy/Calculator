This is a Calculator written in Kotlin for Android and using Jetpack Compose.  This is a personal project and my first ever application written for Android.

The calculator contains Number[0-9], Operator[+,-,*,/], Sign[+/-], Equal[=], Decimal[.] and Clear[C] buttons.  Invalid inputs are handled by preventing the user from pressing a button when it is invalid to do so.

I am also working on other projects with other people, one of which is a full stack web application.  I will keep updating and fixing bugs as needed.

Let me know if you have any feedback!
