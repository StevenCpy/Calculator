This is a Calculator written in Kotlin for Android and using Jetpack Compose.  This is a personal project and my first ever application written for Android.

The calculator contains Number[0-9], Operator[+,-,*,/], Sign[+/-], Equal[=], Decimal[.] and Clear[C] buttons.  Invalid inputs are handled by preventing the user from pressing a button when it is invalid to do so.
